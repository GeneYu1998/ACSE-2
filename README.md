# ACSE-2

This repository contains all the lecture and study materials for ACSE-2 November 2020.

**ACSE-2**  introduces mathematical essentials and physical equations for modelling a range of dynamic processes 

The **SCHEDULE** for ACSE-2 is as follows:

	Every week there will be 4 days of lectures and workshops (Monday through Thursday).
	There will be timed coursework that tests you on the material covered that week on Friday.

	Week 1 (2-6 November) is taught by Prof. Matthew Piggott and will cover an introduction/reminder of essential linear algebra and basic concepts for mathematical and numerical modelling

	Week 2 (9-13 November) is taught by Prof. Saskia Goes and will cover the basics of continuum mechanics

	Week 3 (16-20 November) is taught by Prof. Stephen Neethling and will cover several basic fluid and potential flow cases.

We have organised the **CLASS MATERIAL** in three folders for each of the three weeks.
